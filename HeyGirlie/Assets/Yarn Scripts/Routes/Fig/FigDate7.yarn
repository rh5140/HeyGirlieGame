March 29
Leviathan is bustling when you arrive, with pirates shouting over one another and shoving into you as you attempt to make your way down the street. Fig didn’t exactly give you directions. Just a note under your door asking you to come to Leviathan after school.
You sigh, glancing around, half expecting her to just appear out of nowhere. And, as if the universe is determined to keep you on your toes, something collides with you. Hard.
<<kristen Surprised>>
<<voiceline KristenSurprised3>>
You let out a grunt of surprise as a very familiar, very panicked tiefling literally jumps onto you. You stumble back, barely managing to catch yourself before you both go down.
<<char_right FigSurprised>>
Kristen: Fig?! What the fuck?!
Fig pulls back just enough for you to see her wide, panicked eyes. What the heck could have happened already? You <i>just</i> got here!
Fig: Okay, listen. LISTEN. Ayda has lost her goddamn mind. I am so serious right now.
<<kristen Awkward>>
<<voiceline KristenNeutral3>>
Kristen: Uh… what?
Fig grabs your shoulders and shakes you. Uh oh… Whatever’s going on can’t be good. Fig is utterly losing it.
<<voiceline FigSurprised4>>
Fig: I can’t explain! It’s too much! We need to go NOW!
Before you can ask even a single follow-up question, Fig grabs your wrist and starts dragging you down the street.
You barely have time to register where you’re going before you arrive at The Golden Gardens - Garty O’Briens one-stop-shop for all manners of pleasures.
<<kristen Surprised>>
And standing outside, waiting with absolute patience, is Ayda.
<<char_left FigSurprised>>
<<char_right AydaNeutral>>
Ayda: Ah. You made it. Excellent.
Fig stops short, still gripping onto your arm, breathing fast. She points accusingly at Ayda.
<<char_left FigAnnoyed>>
<<voiceline FigAngry3>>
Fig: Tell her what you did!
Ayda blinks. Tilts her head. Then gestures toward the building, as if this should be completely obvious.
Ayda: I arranged a three-person massage.
<i>.................. Huhhhhh?</i>
<<kristen Awkward>>
<<voiceline KristenSurprised3>>
Kristen: You… did what?
Fig throws her hands in the air, turning wildly back to you to gauge your reaction.
<<char_left FigSurprised>>
<<voiceline FigSurprised4>>
Fig: See?! SEE!? She’s completely lost it.
Ayda: You expressed discomfort regarding your ability to remain calm when discussing emotions. Therefore, I sought a solution that would create a relaxed atmosphere and encourage openness.
<i>What do you make of that, Applebees?</i>


-> Y’know what? Why the hell not.
  <<kristen Grin>>
  <<voiceline KristenNeutral1>>
  Kristen: Okay, but like… a massage does sound kind of nice.
  Fig whirls on you so fast she almost trips.
  <<char_left FigAnnoyed>>
  <<voiceline FigAngry1>>
  Fig: You are NOT taking her side??
  Kristen: I mean… loosened muscles, a relaxed environment, no awkward tension? Kind of genius.
  Ayda: Precisely.
  <<add_points 0>>
-> You gotta process this.
  <<kristen Nervous>>
  <<voiceline KristenAwkward2>>
  Kristen: I… I literally do not know how to react to this.
  Fig throws her hands up.
  <<char_left FigFlustered>>
  <<voiceline FigSigh2>>
  Fig: EXACTLY. THANK YOU. See, Ayda? Even Kristen thinks this is a lot.
  <<char_right AydaThink>>
  Ayda: She simply said she does not know how to react. That does not imply disapproval.
  Fig lets out a wheeze of frustration. Meanwhile, you’re just standing there, trying to piece together how this is your actual life right now.
  <<add_points 1>>


<<kristen Neutral>>
<<char_left FigNeutral>>
<<char_right AydaNeutral>>
You head inside and you still can’t tell if this is about to be the worst or the best thing to ever happen to you.
When Ayda leads you into a dim room, ethereal mist constructs take form, floating around as they begin preparing the session. The next thing you know, you’re all lying face down on massage tables, dressed in nothing but silk towels, with warm oil being worked into your skin.
Fig: So we’re all in this dimly lit room together, covered in oils, and it’s supposed to be relaxing? This feels suspiciously like a setup.
<<voiceline KristenHappy4>>
Kristen: I feel like I missed a chapter… But also, this is really dope, thanks Ayda.
<<char_right AydaThink>>
Ayda: Fig was so uncomfortable discussing her feelings for you with me that I determined this was the most effective solution to get her out of her shell.
Fig lets out a loud, exhausted groan, flopping her hands down uselessly on either side of the massage table.
Fig: The only thing I’m out of right now is my clothes.
You laugh as Fig shifts, clearly still too flustered to function. One of the mist constructs presses firmly into your shoulders. You have to admit… <i>This feels really good!</i>
<<char_right AydaNeutral>>
Ayda: Fig very much enjoyed your date at the Black Pit and would like to continue exploring it.
<<char_left FigFlustered>>
<<voiceline FigAyda3>>
Fig: Ayda, can you, like, maybe not say everything that pops into your head? Not everyone thrives on radical honesty, babe. Some of us prefer repression.
You can’t help but grin. Honestly, it’s kind of adorable. You turn slightly, glancing over at Ayda, who is watching you with her usual curiosity.


-> Admit you want it, too
  <<kristen Soft>>
  <<voiceline KristenRomantic1>>
  Kristen: I’d really love that too. Like… a lot.
  Fig freezes. Then, very slowly, she turns her head just enough to peek at you through her messy bangs. Her face flushes dark red and she tries to bury her face back into her arms. But she’s smiling.
  <<char_left FigNeutral>>
  <<voiceline FigBlush2>>
  Fig: …You’re such a loser.
  <<add_points 1>>
-> Actually… You’re a little flustered
  <<kristen Nervous>>
  <<voiceline KristenAwkward3>>
  Kristen: Uh. Wow. Okay. That’s… That’s cool. Very cool.
  Fig lifts her head to stare at you, eyes narrowing.
  <<char_left FigNeutral>>
  <<voiceline FigNeutral3>>
  Fig: Wait… Are you flustered?
  Kristen: No…
  Fig grins widely and turns to Ayda like this is the discovery of a lifetime.
  <<char_left FigHappy>>
  <<voiceline FigLaugh1>>
  Fig: Ayda! Get the notebook.
  Ayda: I already have extensive notes on this interaction.
  <<add_points 0>>


<<kristen Neutral>>
<<char_left FigNeutral>>
The mist constructs continue their work, kneading away whatever lingering stress Fig has been carrying. And for the first time since this conversation started… she actually starts to relax.
Fig: Okay… so. I wanna do this. Like, actually do this. With you, Kristen.
Your heart skips a beat. Fig pauses, chewing on her lip, choosing her words carefully.
<<char_left FigFlustered>>
<<voiceline FigAwkward1>>
Fig: It’s just kinda confusing, y’know? ‘Cause I love Ayda. I love her a lot. And it’s weird to be sitting here like, ‘Oh, I have feelings for Kristen, too. That’s allowed, right?’ Like, what even is my brain doing?
Fig lets out a nervous chuckle, but Ayda steps in before there’s any chance of her grabbing her skateboard and kickflipping out of the room.
<<char_left FigNeutral>>
<<char_right AydaSoft>>
Ayda: Fig, my love. I would sooner count every star in the sky than ever believe your heart was meant for only one person. You are a storm, a wildfire. You are a force too powerful, too boundless, to ever be contained within a single definition of love.
<<kristen Soft>>
<i>Holy shit. That was beautiful.</i>
<<char_left FigFlustered>>
Fig’s face immediately flushes the deepest shade of red. She lets out a half-choked laugh as she tries to cover her burning cheeks.
<<voiceline FigLaugh1>>
Fig: Okaaaay, you need to chill. Like. Right now.
Ayda simply smiles. If you could have half the amount of love these two have, you’d be one happy girlie.
Ayda: I love you, Figueroth Faeth.
Fig groans into her hands, but beaming from ear to ear.
<<char_left FigBlush>>
<<voiceline FigRomantic5>>
Fig: I love you too, nerd.
Watching how safe Fig feels with Ayda and how easily they understand each other makes you feel warm. Finally, Fig turns to you again.
<<kristen Neutral>>
<<char_left FigNeutral>>
<<char_right AydaNeutral>>
Fig: I guess what Ayda and I have talked about is… dating you doesn’t change how much I love her. It’s just… More. Like, this whole thing isn’t about choosing between you guys. It’s about letting myself have more. And I wanna do that.


-> NOW is the time to be romantic
  <<kristen Soft>>
  <<voiceline KristenRomanticFig1>>
  Kristen: Well, lucky me. Getting to date you is a hell of a privilege.
  Fig blinks. Her ears twitch. She turns her head away so fast you think she might give herself whiplash.
  <<char_left FigFlustered>>
  <<voiceline FigBlush1>>
  Fig: Oh my god. Applebees. What the fuck.
  <<char_right AydaThink>>
  Ayda smiles at you, nodding in approval.
  Ayda: An excellent response.
  <<add_points 1>>
-> Stick to being goofy. Ayda is the romantic one.
  <<kristen Grin>>
  <<voiceline KristenHappy1>>
  Kristen: So, like… does this mean you get extra gifts on Valentine’s Day now?
  Fig snorts loudly. Ayda tilts her head, considering.
  <<char_right AydaThink>>
  Ayda: Logically, yes. Statistically, she should receive twice as many romantic gestures as a standard monogamous partner.
  <<char_left FigSurprised>>
  <<voiceline FigSigh2>>
  Fig groans and faceplants on the table.
  Fig: That’s it! You’re both going to drive me certifiably insane.
  <<add_points 0>>


<<kristen Neutral>>
<<char_left FigNeutral>>
<<char_right AydaNeutral>>
What started as an absolute chaotic disaster of over-the-top dramatics has finally settled. Maybe you can actually enjoy this massage after all.
Ayda looks at Fig with an unwavering warmth, as do you.
<<char_right AydaSoft>>
Ayda: I am incredibly proud of you, Fig.
<<char_left FigFlustered>>
<<voiceline FigSurprised4>>
Fig: Uh… for what?
Ayda: For allowing yourself to be open. For recognizing that your heart is capable of more than you once believed. For stepping into this new part of yourself without fear.
Fig lets out a short laugh, resting her chin on her forearms.
<<voiceline FigLaugh2>>
<<char_left FigNeutral>>
Fig: Oh no, don’t say that, Ayda. Now I feel like I have to be brave about it.
Ayda: You have always been brave, my love.
<<char_right AydaNeutral>>
You watch as Fig processes that, clearly thinking faster than her brain could keep up. <i>You’ve been there.</i>
Fig: So, Ayda… would you ever consider it? Y’know… Getting the feels for someone other than me?
Ayda’s expression doesn’t change. She tilts her head slightly, considering the question.
<<char_right AydaThink>>
Ayda: Polyamory has always been an intellectual curiosity of mine. Logistically, I find the concept intriguing. But at my core, I do not seek another love, because I have already found the light of my every lifetime.
Fig sucks in a breath as Ayda’s words land like they are irrefutable truth.
<<kristen Nervous>>
But… Sweet Cassandra… <i>Here comes that word vomit again.</i>


-> Yeah but… The more the merrier
  Kristen: What about me?
  <<voiceline KristenRomantic3>>
  <<char_left FigSurprised>>
  Fig’s head snaps toward you and her eyes go wide. Ayda, however, remains composed. Her gaze shifts to you and she considers your words carefully.
  Ayda: Do you believe your light is meant to align with mine?
  You glance at Fig, who still looks stunned, but not against the idea. If anything, she looks like she’s holding her breath.
  -> Yes
    <<ayda_condition>>
    <<kristen Neutral>>
    Kristen: Yeah. I think I do. It just… Makes sense, right?
    Fig makes a noise between a gasp and a squeak. Ayda gives a small nod.
    <<char_right AydaSoft>>
    Ayda: Then we must talk. Openly. With care.
    <<kristen Nervous>>
    <<voiceline KristenSurprised1>>
    <i>Well shit… This is actually happening, then.</i>
    Fig: Wait… Seriously? Just like that?
    Ayda: I shall accompany the both of you on a date and we shall put it to the test.
    // <<THIS WILL CAUSE THE POLY DATE 8 AND POLY SPRING FLING>>
  -> Just kidding
    <<kristen Awkward>>
    <i>Oh shit. You just asked Ayda if she would consider dating you too.</i>
    <<voiceline KristenAwkward2>>
    Kristen: Wait. WAIT. Just kidding! JOKES! That was a joke! Ha ha! So funny, right?!
    <<char_left FigHappy>>
    <<voiceline FigLaugh2>>
    Fig collapses onto the table, absolutely wheezing with laughter. Ayda blinks slowly.
    <<char_right AydaNeutral>>
    Ayda: Ah. You were making a jest. It was… an interesting one.
    <<kristen Neutral>>
    Fig shoves you weakly. You shove her back. Ayda remains unshaken, but it’s clear this is the end of that particular conversation.
    // <<THIS WILL NOT CAUSE POLY ALTS>>
  <<add_points 0>>
-> Agree with Ayda
  <<kristen Soft>>
  <<char_right AydaNeutral>>
  You smile slightly, watching the way Ayda and Fig look at each other. The way Fig’s entire body reacts to Ayda’s words. You get it. Completely.
  Kristen: Yeah. You’re right. Fig’s… really special.
  <<char_left FigFlustered>>
  <<voiceline FigBlush2>>
  Fig groans immediately, burying her face in her arms. But her ears twitch and you catch the ghost of a smile tugging at her lips.
  Fig: Ugh. You guys. This is too much.
  <<add_points 1>>


<<kristen Neutral>>
<<char_left FigNeutral>>
<<char_right AydaNeutral>>
The massage session comes to an end and the mist constructs dissipate into nothing. Ayda is the first to move, standing and adjusting the towel around herself. She moves to Fig, leans down and kisses the top of her head.
Ayda: I must return to work. However, I am confident in your ability to arrange something for next week.
Fig: Aye aye, captain.
Ayda nods in satisfaction, then turns to you.
<<char_right AydaThink>>
Ayda: You are a fascinating anomaly, Kristen Applebees.
<<voiceline KristenNeutral1>>
<<kristen Surprised>>
You blink. You have no idea what to do with that information. Before you can reply, Ayda simply turns and leaves. You sit up, covering yourself with the towel. Fig does the same.
<<char_left transparent>>
<<char_right FigNeutral>>
<<kristen Neutral>>
Fig: That was probably the highest compliment you’ll ever get from Ayda.
You snort, still not entirely sure what just happened today, but willing to roll with it. Fig pulls her towel a little tighter around herself, and is notably avoiding eye contact with you. She’s definitely psyching herself up.

<<voiceline FigAwkward2>>
Fig: So, uh… do you wanna maybe… come to the Bottomless Pit again next week? We can do it right, this time. I have a hot tub…
You raise an eyebrow, smirking slightly. <i>This went from 0 to 100 REAL fast.</i>
<<char_right FigSurprised>>
<<voiceline FigSurprised2>>
Fig: I mean! Y'know, it's just a cool place. And I happen to rule it. And, like. It’s kinda romantic. But not in a weird way! Just in a normal, super casual way where we just happen to be alone in a steamy, private hot tub. Together. Totally not weird at all.


-> Oh, so you’re trying to woo me now, huh?
  <<kristen Grin>>
  <<char_right FigFlustered>>
  <<voiceline FigSurprised4>>
  Fig: I—WOO YOU?! NO! I mean—YES?! Wait. NO. I mean—OH MY GOD.
  You laugh as she buries her face in her hands, groaning   loudly.
  <<add_points 1>>
-> Oh, yes, of course. The ‘steamy hot tub’ move.
  <<kristen Grin>>
  Kristen: Timeless. A true classic. No romantic intent whatsoever.
  <<char_right FigAnnoyed>>
  <<voiceline FigAngry1>>
  You laugh as she buries her face in her hands, groaning loudly.
  Fig: You suck. That was so hard for me!
  <<add_points 0>>


<<kristen Neutral>>
<<char_right FigNeutral>>
Fig finally pulls herself together. Sort of. She rolls her shoulders back like she’s physically resetting her brain, stands up and tightens the towel around her body. She places her hands on her hips and nods firmly to herself.
Fig: Okay. Okay. So we’re actually doing this. And I’m going to process it properly over the next five business days.
You snort as Fig starts pacing, one hand waving vaguely as she rambles.
<<char_right FigFlustered>>
<<voiceline FigSigh1>>
Fig: That means no running away, no existential crisis in the middle of the night, no screaming into a pillow until my throat gives out. Just—normal processing. Like a normal person. Like a very normal, well-adjusted person who totally isn’t freaking out about dating one of her best friends.
<<kristen Grin>>
<<voiceline KristenHappy2>>
Kristen: As student body president, I’d like to personally thank you for this business day courtesy. Real professional.
<<char_right FigSurprised>>
Fig stops dead in her tracks. Her eyes snap to you, and for a second, you think she’s about to say something witty back. Instead, she just… Stares at you. If it wasn’t Fig, you would be mega creeped out.
Then, without any warning, she crosses the room in two quick strides, leans down, and presses the softest, most awkward kiss to your cheek.
<<kristen Surprised>>
When Fig pulls back, she won’t meet your eyes.
<<char_right FigFlustered>>
Fig: Okay. Leaving now. This was fun. Great talk. See you later. No take-backsies.
She turns so fast that she smacks the side of the massage table. She grumbles under her breath, tightens her towel, and heads toward the door.
<<kristen Neutral>>
Before she leaves, she glances back one last time, lips twitching like she’s trying not to smile.
<<char_right FigBlush>>
<<voiceline FigLaugh2>>
Fig: By the way… you’re still naked.
<<kristen Nervous>>
And then she’s gone.
<<char_right transparent>>
You sit there for a moment, attempting to scramble your thoughts together. The date is set. Fig just kissed you on the face. You exhale, shaking your head, still smiling. Until…
<<kristen Neutral>>
You look around the room. And very suddenly realize—
<<kristen Awkward>>
<<voiceline KristenAngry3>>
Kristen: …Wait. Where the fuck are my clothes?
<<jump Cassandra>>
