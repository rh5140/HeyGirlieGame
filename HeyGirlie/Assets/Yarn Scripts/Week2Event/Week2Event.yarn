It’s another beautiful weekend morning, and instead of enjoying it in bed, you’re up bright and early to go to the Elmville Art and Culture Museum. Maybe it’s too bright. Maybe it’s too early. Maybe you should’ve left Fabian’s board game night after he lost the second time and started breaking things.

But as Aguefort’s senior class president, you know better than to miss out on the senior class field trip.

You and the rest of the Bad Kids — even Fig, who despite no longer being enrolled at Aguefort had declared that weekends were <i>her</i> time with her friends, and it’d be a cold day in Hell before she let that get taken away from her — all sip on Riz’s too-strong coffee and stand at the back of the large crowd that’s assembled in the museum lobby.
:You look around to see if anyone ditched: there’s the rest of your cleric class, there’s Skrank and the AV club, there’s the Rat Grinders, there’s Max Durden and Buddy Dawn, even Molman and the soil club are here! 
:You even spot some non-Aguefort students: you see some Hudol kids and some kids from the local college walk through the front doors and slip into the exhibits. This has got to be the busiest day the museum’s seen in a while.

Arthur Aguefort stands at the center of the room, Vice Principal Gilear Faeth at his side, and claps his hands. The crowd of students goes silent. 

“Thank you all for being here. Of course, the other option was detention until you graduate.” He chuckles. “As I’ve always said, the best way for an adventurer to learn is for an adventurer to do! Go forth, and wreak havoc upon the museum.”

A museum worker at the front desk cuts in. “Do NOT wreak havoc upon the museum.”

Aguefort sighs. “Fine. Don’t do anything a mending cantrip couldn’t fix. Now fly free!” He disappears in a gust of wind and a puff of smoke, sending museum guides and maps flying everywhere.

The worker heaves a sigh and flips off the lobby smoke detector. “He does this every year.”

Where do you want to go?
